## Event-Driven Architecture in Python

Event-Driven Architecture implemented in Python with RabbitMQ and Docker. You have full access to the messages and service configurations. **This project is based on [Event-Driven Architecture in Python](https://imsadra.me/event-driven-architecture-in-python) articles on Hashnode**.

### Setup

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

#### 1. Install docker and docker-compose

Use the following tutorials to make `docker` and `docker-compose` ready on your machine.

- [Docker setup guide for Linux, Windows, and Mac users](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- [Docker-compose installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

#### 2. Clone this project

Open a fresh terminal tab and run the following commands.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/lnxpy/event-driven-in-python.git
```
```shell
cd event-driven-in-python
```

#### 3. Install the dependencies

You can either create a virtual environement or do nothing in case of installing the required packages.

##### with virtualenv
```shell
virtualenv venv
```
```shell
source venv/bin/activate
```
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##### without virtualenv
```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Start the compose

Make sure your Docker Daemon is working fine and your Docker service is running with the following command on Linux distributions.

```shell
sudo systemctl status docker
```

Then, start pulling the images and run a container on the background.

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

#### 4. Customize the configurations

Open `settings/configs.py` file in a text editor and make changes. The default configuration might be fine for the rest of the project and your tests.

#### 5. Start producing and consuming

You can change the variable `MESSAGE` from `settings/configs.py` to make your own message pattern with some additional keys. Once you made your changes, 
create two fresh terminal tabs and run both `producer.py` and `consumer.py` each by each. Since `producet.py` declares the queue, make sure you run the producer module first. For more message fields, check out `settings/volumes.py`. Make sure you use the exact key name as your message fields.
